### Simple sample project with Photon Networking
* This github repository is just the scripts, the unity game scenes are only saved locally at the moment.
* Three different ways for users to join a match with each other
* QuickStartLobbies, DelayedStartLobbies and custom created lobbies to post on a server lobby list
* DelayedStartLobby can join up to three devices into a game lobby as shown by the video above.
* The first device that joins is the MasterClient that hosts the fighting robots
* The next two devices spawn various fish that control the inputs of the robots on the MasterClient
* The first device controls the blue robot
* The second controls the red robot

### Credits
* I used the Male Fighter Mecanim Animation Pack from the Unity Asset Store to have access to sample avatars and fighting animations to build this project.
